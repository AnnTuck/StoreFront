# StoreFront
Node.js Express mySQL sequelize StoreFront

Basic MVP of a Storefront with limited UI.
Displays store products, registers sales, adds new products and departments.


List of improvements needed for basic functionality:

Need to clear sale total and low inventory alerts after each sale.

Screen needs to refresh after each sale, inventory addition, new product addition, new department addition.

Refactor code to clean up old tests, console logs, and redundant code.

Add departments that were added in the supervisor's screen to the scroll selector on the manager's screen.

Re-do UI.
